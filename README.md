PyChain Ledger

This project uses streamlit to showcase a pychain blockchain. "Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required."
The concept of this ledger is to allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
